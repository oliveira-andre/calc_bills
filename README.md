# Calculate Bills

This project was idealized by me, when i started to note my bills in Markdown
but the design of tables was hard to code, then as a programmer i automatized it
i combine some simple select options, to calculate my bills and generate my template tables
isn't perfect sometimes but still much faster than write the code.

## How to use

- install ruby 3.0.0
- don't use decimals, all numbers must be mutiplied by hundred (value * 100)

```

```
